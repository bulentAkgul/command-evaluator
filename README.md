# Command Evaluator

This is a helper package, and it can't be used independently. Its purpose is to evaluate the console commands that are shipped with the other packages, which are part of [**Packagified Laravel**](https://github.com/bulentAkgul/packagified-laravel), to ensure that they are valid.

#### DISCLAIMER

It should be production-ready but hasn't been tested enough. You should use it carefully since this package will evaluate the commands manipulating your files and folders.
